                        The Mugen is a speaker that can be rotated around its own axis, providing the
                        user with the freedom to direct the music coming out of the speakers to any
                        direction they want. 
                    </p>

                        It is designed to mimic the natural opening movement of
                        a flower, giving the music a ‘blooming’ aesthetic. This is configured by using
                        different modes, that are allocated to several magnetic contact points in the
                        corners of the pyramids.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By rotating the speakers outwards, the volume increases. Rotate them inwards and the music eventually stops, when you reach
                        the closed position. It is completely wireless due to the use of bluetooth and
                        concealed batteries, making it retain its aesthetics without being interrupted by
                        cables or buttons.
