                        The Mugen is a speaker that can be rotated around its own axis, providing the
                        user with the freedom to direct the music coming out of the speakers to any
                        direction they want.

                        It is designed to mimic the natural opening movement of
                        a flower, giving the music a ‘blooming’ aesthetic. This is configured by using
                        different modes, that are allocated to several magnetic contact points in the
                        corners of the pyramids.

                        By rotating the speakers outwards, the volume increases. Rotate them inwards to close and the music eventually stops.
                        It is completely wireless thanks to the use of bluetooth and
                        LiPo batteries, making it retain its dynamics without being interrupted by
                        cables or buttons.

                        Due to the size and shape of the speakers, it was necessary to transfer from the regular Arduino Uno to a smaller scaled Arduino Mini. Next to this the circuit boards needed to be small enough to fit in the pyramids, while retaining enough space to hold the amplifiers and other components. For this I made custom circuit boards.

                        The Mugen speakers give a haptic enhancement to the volume when you rotate it, as seen above. When two speakers move towards each other, the volume goes down and eventually when they touch and close, the volume drops to zero.
