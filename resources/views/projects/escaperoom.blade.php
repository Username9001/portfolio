            <p>
                This escape room was part of a bigger game containing multiple escape rooms.
                The tokens and minigames that were part of this game were carried out by using the tools that we supplied and programmed.
                These tools work together on the OOCSI network, where they can communicate and let the players have a constant thread running through the areas.
