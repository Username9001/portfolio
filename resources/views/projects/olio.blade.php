                            This research studies
                            behavioural change within the everyday practices of a shared
                            kitchen with the use of an interactive tool. To narrow down
                            the subject of this research the following question was for-
                            mulated: ’Can an interactive tagging tool change ones be-
                            haviour and create a feeling of shared responsibility con-
                            cerning clutter in communal kitchens in student houses?’In
                            answering this question it is hoped to give researchers and
                            designers more insight into the everyday practices in com-
                            munal spaces, wherein diverse and opinionated people might
                            share a living space.

                            Olio is a social persuasive system, meant to trigger commu-
                            nication and behavioural change in cleaning up of individuals
                            in the context of student households. The system consists out
                            of six units that was designed to be used as a tag for mess in
                            communal spaces.

                            A unit can be placed by one of the housemates when they consider that something is messy. If you
                            are the one being tagged it is your duty to clean it up and be-
                            come more aware of how your mess influences the daily life
                            of your housemates. The engagement with Olio is designed
                            to fit in the everyday practices of student life, with the inten-
                            tion to create a shared feeling of responsibility towards clutter
                            and to become an easier topic to talk about.

                            Olio was tested by deploying Olio in two different student households with a
                            total of 12 participants for four weeks. It was measured by
                            observations and regular semi structured interviews with the
                            participants individually and in a group setting. Results of the
                            deployment show an increase of awareness of the mess being
                            made and a trigger of discussions within the group about clut-
                            ter. With Olio, we also explore the individual change within
                            a group, which has to this date been underexplored within the
                            field of persuasive HCI. Design implications for behavioural
                            change for an individual within a community are proposed.
